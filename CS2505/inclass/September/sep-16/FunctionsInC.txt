Functions in C

Functions in C come in separate parts

We need to do these steps

1. We need to declare our functions before we call them.
2. We need to define, or write, the functions.
3. We need to call the function.

The function definition can serve as the delcaration, if you define the function before you call it.

We delcare our functions in header files
Header files are files that end in .h
We #include our header files into our c files
We do not compile our header files explicitly

the return type
the names of the function
the list of parameters

int my_function(intx, unt z, double z);

it ends with a semicolon

the function definition then

int my_function(int x, int z, double z) {

    //stuff with x y and z

    return <some int>;
}
