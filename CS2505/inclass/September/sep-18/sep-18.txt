C Functions and Compiling Process

Compiling a program is a 4 step process.

1. The preprocessor 
2. The compiler
3. The assembler
4. The linker

1. The preprocessor

cpp - is the c preprocessor

We invoke it like this: cpp main.c 
it will then spit out the results to the command line 
If we want to "capture" the results we can use
commandline redirection

cc is the c compiler 
we invoke it like cc -S main.c to create an assembly file.
These two steps, cpp and cc, produce human "readable" files
or files that are in plain text

as is the assembler it produces a binary file
the file it makes is called a.out

ld is the linker 
it's job is to find all of the parts for the program 
and hook them up so when we run, we have access to
the utilies we need, e.g. printf 
the output for the linker is also a binary file, but 
we can execute it, or run it.
