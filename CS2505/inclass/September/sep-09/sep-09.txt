Introduction to C

C is not Java

C is Java's ancestor in the line of languages
Java is inspired by C and C++

Java is a what kind of language? Or said this way, Java uses what paradigm to programming?
Object Oriented
Objects have instance variables, data
    The data should be private. (why? because encapsulation meaning it keeps outside factors from messing with your data)
Objects have methods, or functions

A method is a function that is attached to a class or Object

C uses what paradigm?
Procedural.
The procedural paradigm is about data flow, as in, data flows into a function,
is modified, and then flows out or back.

C does not have classes.
C does have structs. A struct is like a class but the data is all public and there are no methods.

When we use the new keyboard in C, we are allocating memory, just like in Java, but in C there is no automatic garbage collection, so we must clean up our own messes

In order to use dynamic memory allocation, or memoy that was allocated using new, we must use pointers.

Most of our variables will not use new when we create them.

int x;

C does not automatically initialize your variables. So you must do it yourself

int x = 0;
or 
int x;
x = 0;
