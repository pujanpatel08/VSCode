When we have a mutli byte value, either the low ednded byte or high ended byte is stored first

Low ended bytes are on the right of the number
High ended bytes are on the left of the number

0x12AB34CD

0x12 are the high bytes
0xCD are the low bytes

High bytes add more value to the number
Low bytes add less value to the number

e.g. 1 vs 10. Which 1 adds more value
1 vs 10000. Which 1 adds more value
