# File Extensions

- What are those little parts of filenames that come after the dot?

examples: pdf, txt, java, png, c, md, h, 

Who are these exentions for?
These are for the operating system.
These are also for us, so we can "tell" what's in the file.

# File permission

When we do ls -l we see a long listing of our files.

total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 408 Sep  2 16:41 sep-02.txt

We are the root user.
The root is the admin of the container
We are also in the root group

Then there are 3 sets of persmissions related to reading, 
    writing and executing

We can control who has access to files using these persmissions

The 3 groups of people are

You the owner
Your group
and Others

We can add or remove permissions

# Archives

- Two main Archives

1. Tar 
2. Zip

Tar - stands for tape archive 
    - not compressed
Zip - is compressed 


Let's make a tar file.

to make a tar you use the tar command

tar cvf <name of tar file> files to tar

when you make a tar you need to give options

c - means create
v - verbose - it's optional and means show me the work
f - means file - it comes last

Let's make a zip file

zip <name of file to zip> files to zip 


How to extract

tar xvf file.tar
unzip file.zip
